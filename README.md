# Digit-Spinner-Project
Android Game Project of Summer 2018

This is a small game made on Unity 2019.1.10f1 which served as a project to study modern game engine workflow, UX/UI and game design along with the apects of game publishing, which include marketing, testing and distribution of the game.

The workload was spread over three team members and extensive planning has been done prior to actual development.

The Android build makes use of Google Play Services which changed a lot over the years, so there is no guarantee they will be working later (leaderboards and achievements are still accessible as of 21.01.21).
